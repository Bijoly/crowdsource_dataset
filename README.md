# Crowdsource_dataset
This repository contains two crowdsourced chat datasets between requesters and workers. **Dataset 1** covers conversations on a specific task, while **Dataset 2** features chats from ten tasks related to abstract art analysis. These datasets offer valuable insights into task-based communication, collaboration, and decision-making processes.
# Crowdsourced Chat Datasets
This repository contains two crowdsourced conversation datasets between requesters and workers collaborating on task-oriented projects. These datasets offer insights into task-specific communication, collaborative problem-solving, and decision-making processes.
# Datasets Overview
1. Dataset 1
Description: Contains conversations centered on a specific task (details available in the dataset).
Format: Structured chat logs between requesters and workers.
Use Case: Useful for task-specific dialogue analysis and behavior modeling.
2. Dataset 2: Analysis of Abstract Art
Description: Features conversations related to ten distinct tasks focused on analyzing abstract art. These tasks involve interpreting art, recognizing features, and evaluating artistic styles.
Format: Chat logs organized by task type, capturing discussions between requesters and workers.
Use Case: Supports research on task-driven dialogue, contextual understanding, and communication strategies.
# Data Format
File Types: CSV 
Structure: Each file includes task-specific metadata, timestamps, and conversation text.
# Usage Guidelines
Research & Development: Ideal for training chatbots, studying human-computer interaction, and understanding task-oriented communication.
Academic Purposes: If used in publications or academic work, please cite this repository accordingly.
